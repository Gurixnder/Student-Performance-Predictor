# Student-Performance-Predictor
This system predicts a student's performance using linear regression regression model using the independent variables like number of hours studied, number of sample question papers solved and marks received on previous exam.
r2 score and mean square error are used to find the accuracy of the model.
A simple website has been created using streamlit library in python to implemet the system.
